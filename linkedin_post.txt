Hi everyone — I built a modular Library Manager API using Flask and PostgreSQL, and I wanted to share the project and the lessons learned.

What it does:
- Manage users, books, and borrow/return transactions
- Exposes RESTful endpoints for all core operations
- Keeps business logic clear and modular using Flask Blueprints

Why I built it:
- To learn better project structure for Flask apps
- To practice SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL schema design
- To create a small but real-world backend I can extend

Quick setup (local):
1. Install PostgreSQL and create a database (see README.md)
2. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
	python run.py

Repo: <REPO_LINK_PLACEHOLDER>

If you have feedback, ideas for features, or want to pair on extending it (pagination, auth, migrations), I’d love to hear from you. #Flask #Python #Postgres #APIDevelopment
